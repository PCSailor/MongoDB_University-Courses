# pip is an installer like 'npm install' is
# Pymongo is the glue connecting a program to the database // like Mongoose in Node
# Python lists are formated the same as JSON
a = ['01-listItem', '02-listItem', '03-listItem', '04-listItem','05-listItem', '06-listItem']
# Python Lists_Slice Operator
a[1:3] 
prints ['02-listItem', '03-listItem'] 
notice the index starts at 0 (like arrays) and does not include the last index with the request (i.e.: 3 '04-listItem' is left out)

# Python Dicts
Similar to JSON Objects
Python does not keep the order of keys but JSON does
Using the 'in' operator in a List, python checks each list value.
Using the 'in' operator in a Dict, python checks for the item in each key.
# Python Variables
variables often do not need to be declared (i.e.: for loops) because in python they are all dynamic
# Indentation is important because control flow is implied by indentation
The code results changes depending on the indentation
# Functions
Every function in python starts with 'def', followed by function name, followed by parenthesis and any arguments passed in and then a colon
# Bottle Framework
# This is a web server
# These are the basic parts the same in all bottle programs
    See 08_bottle-framework_hello-world.py
# .tpl template view files
Comments can not be after Python code or get error
When using templates, a folder called 'views' must be used
